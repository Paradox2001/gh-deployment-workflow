  <h1>Hello, GitHub Actikkjkjlksfdlkjkkjjdsfkmsdmfsskjkdslsdksdonr</h1>
  <p>What I Learned from This Project
1. Understanding of CI/CD Concepts:
I learned the fundamentals of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) by setting up a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys my site whenever a specific file (index.html) changes.

2. GitHub Actions Workflows:
I learned how to write a GitHub Actions workflow in YAML to automate tasks. Specifically, I wrote a workflow (deploy.yml) that:

Listens for changes pushed to the main branch.

Only triggers if index.html is modified.

Deploys the changes to GitHub Pages.

3. GitHub Pages Deployment:
I understood how to host static websites using GitHub Pages, and how to automate deployments through GitHub Actions without manual steps.

4. Real-world Automation Setup:
This project gave me experience with real-world deployment automation – something that's critical in modern software development.

5. (Optional Stretch Goal)
If I wanted to expand this project, I could integrate a static site generator like Hugo, Jekyll, or Astro to build a more complete website (e.g. a portfolio), and automate that build and deployment process </p>
  <p>“I learned how to use GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of a static website to GitHub Pages, triggered only when specific files change. It taught me the basics of CI/CD and helped me get hands-on experience with real-world deployment workflows.”
